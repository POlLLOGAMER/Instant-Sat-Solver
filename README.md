# Instant-Sat-Solver
Instant SAT solver is a SAT solving algorithm that proves that p=np, because it can solve a SAT problem in polynomial time. That is, the more numbers of variables and clauses there are, the more likely it is that it will solve the SAT problem. In summary, the probability that the SAT is resolved in the first iteration of the algorithm rises exponentially as there are more variables and clauses.

This algorithm works through probability theory, but being used with a reverse engineering technique, that is, the more variables and clauses there are, the more solutions there will be, and the less likely it is that a random combination and its inverse will be false for the SAT problem.
